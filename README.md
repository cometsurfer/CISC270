# CISC270
Database Systems class at NCC

I am a first year computer programming student at Northampton Community College.
This repository is especially for CISC270 - Database Systems.
I am thankful this course is requiring us to learn gitHub.
College is great, it's keeping me focused and productive.
For fun I enjoy creative persuits like art and writing.
As a reward for meeting my goals, I've been treating myself to new art media (currently learning Blender on my own).
I also have been enjoying the Leadership Development series at Northampton NCC.
Clubs I'm sticking with at NCC are Art Connections and Spartan Scribes (poetry writing).
If you have any questions or would like to contact me, please email.
